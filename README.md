# Sleep Debt tracker

I made this app mostly to explore what is capable for making entire apps using LLMs. I used [gptme](https://github.com/ErikBjare/gptme) check it out. Took about 4 hours of actual prompting + debugging + simulations, spent quite some time trying to make flutter_health_connect work.

The app was loosely inspired by the Rise Science sleep app.

Features planned:
	- [x] Sleep debt tracking.
	- [ ] Circardian style energy levels.
	- [ ] Sleep Window + alarm management (partially done).
	- [ ] Better UI styling.
	- [ ] Much more lol.

The UI was mostly written by the LLMs so there might be quirks that don't exactly make sense, in the code at least. I spent a few minutes improving the sleep debt algorithm and running a few simulations (also written with gptme) which you can find in the simulations [directory](./simulations).
